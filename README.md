# Android Stubs

A stub is a piece of software replacing some functionality. In this
case we have some, actually a very limited, replacement classes for
Android. With them you can compile and execute your classes locally.

# Using Android Stubs

Download the latest release, put it in your CLASSPATH and start hacking :)

## Example usage

Lets say you have a domain class for students, ~~~Student~~~.
